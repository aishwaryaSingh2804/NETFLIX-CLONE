# NETFLIX-CLONE
NETFLIX clone using HTML and CSS
The Netflix clone project involved replicating the user interface of Netflix using HTML and CSS. This included creating responsive layouts for various screen sizes, implementing CSS grid and flexbox for structuring and positioning elements, styling components such as navigation bars, carousels, and video player interfaces, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility and accessibility standards were met.
